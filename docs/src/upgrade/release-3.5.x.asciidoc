*The Sleeping Gremlin: No. 18 Entr'acte symphonique*

== TinkerPop 3.5.0

*Release Date: NOT OFFICIALLY RELEASED YET*

Please see the link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/3.5.0/CHANGELOG.asciidoc#release-3-5-0[changelog] for a complete list of all the modifications that are part of this release.

=== Upgrading for Users

==== Java Driver

The `gremlin-driver` has undergone some significant changes that have improved it's usability and stability. By
modifying its request processing model to utilize a single channel, the logic for configuring the driver becomes less
entangled and easier to reason about as the removal of multiplexing eliminates the need to think about simultaneous
connection usage and requests in process. Instead, users simply need to consider the connection pool size which
represents the maximum number of concurrent requests that the client can make to the server.

A number of configuration options have been removed, so expect the potential for compilation problems on upgrade.
Moreover, given the significance of the change in the processing model, expect the need to alter configurations and
application code in some cases to achieve the same performance as before.

For example, as the driver may now open more connections than before, it may be necessary to modify the operating
system setting for the maximum number of open files.

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2205[TINKERPOP-2205]

==== Gryo Usage

Since the first release of TinkerPop 3.x, Gryo has been the default serialization format for Gremlin Server and
Java Driver. It was also used as the default serialization format for Gremlin Console remote connectivity to Gremlin
Server. As of this release, Gryo has been replaced as the default by GraphBinary. All packaged configuration files
and programmatic defaults have been modified as such.

It is still possible to utilize Gryo as a message serialization format by modifying Gremlin Server configuration files
to include the appropriate Gryo configurations. If using Gryo, do not user earlier versions of the driver and server
with 3.5.0. Use a 3.5.0 client to connect to a 3.5.0 server. Generally speaking, mixed version combinations will
appear to work properly, but problems will likely occur during general course of usage and it is therefore not
advisable to take this approach.

For best compatibility between 3.4.x and 3.5.x, please use GraphBinary.

==== Configuration Upgrade

There is a major breaking change in the use of `Configuration` objects. Prior to 3.5.0, `Configuration` objects were
from the Apache Commons `commons-configuration` library, but in this version, they are of `commons-configuration2`.
While this is a breaking change, the fix for most implementations will be quite simple, Simply, change the import
statements from:

[source,text]
----
org.apache.commons.configuration.*
----

to


[source,text]
----
org.apache.commons.configuration2.*
----

It is also worth noting that default list handling in configurations is treated differently. TinkerPop largely
disabled the default list handling approach in `Configuration` 1.x, but if that functionality is still needed, it can
be reclaimed by setting the `LegacyListDelimiterHandler` - details for doing taking this step and other relevant
upgrade information can be found in the link:https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/userguide/upgradeto2_0.html[2.x Upgrade Documentation].

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2185[TINKERPOP-2185]

==== addV() and null

There was a bit of inconsistency in the handling of `null` in calls to `property()` depending on the type of mutation
being executed demonstrated as follows in earlier versions:

[source,text]
----
gremlin> g.V(1).property("x", 1).property("y", null).property("z", 2)
The AddPropertyStep does not have a provided value: AddPropertyStep({key=[y]})
Type ':help' or ':h' for help.
Display stack trace? [yN]N
gremlin> g.addV("test").property("x", 1).property("y", null).property("z", 2)
==>v[13]
gremlin> g.V(13).properties()
==>vp[x->1]
==>vp[z->2]
----

In this release, this behavior has been altered to become consistent as follows:

[source,text]
----
gremlin> g.V(1).property("x", 1).property("y", null).property("z", 2)
Property value can not be null
Type ':help' or ':h' for help.
Display stack trace? [yN]n
gremlin> g.addV().property("x", 1).property("y", null).property("z", 2)
Property value can not be null
Type ':help' or ':h' for help.
Display stack trace? [yN]
----

==== Remote SideEffects

Remote traversals no longer support the retrieval of remote side-effects. Users must therefore directly return
side-effects as part of their query if they need that data. Note that server settings for `TraversalOpProcessor`, which
formerly held the cache for these side-effects, no longer have any effect and can be removed.

=== Upgrading for Provider

==== Graph System Providers

===== TraversalStrategy Application

The methodology for strategy application has been altered and the change is most easily described by example. Given a
traversal with the structure:

[source,text]
----
a(b(),c(d()))
----

Strategies were formerly applied in the following order:

[source,text]
----
StrategyA on a
StrategyB on a
StrategyA on b
StrategyB on b
StrategyA on c
StrategyB on c
StrategyA on d
StrategyB on d
----

This approach has always prevented strategies from performing global operations across the traversal and all decedents
effectively as children will not have been processed by preceding strategies yet. As of this release, the approach
has been altered to apply strategies as follows:

[source,text]
----
StrategyA on a
StrategyA on b
StrategyA on c
StrategyA on d
StrategyB on a
StrategyB on b
StrategyB on c
StrategyB on d
----

In this way, strategy B can check if it is being applied to the root traversal and if it is it knows that A has been
applied globally.

This revised methodology could represent a breaking change for `TraversalStrategy` implementations if they somehow
relied on the old ordering of application. It may also present an opportunity to revise how a `TraversalStrategy` is
written to gain some processing benefit to the new order. Please be sure to review any custom strategies carefully
when upgrading to this version.

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-1568[TINKERPOP-1568]

===== AbstractOpProcessor API Change

The `generateMetaData()` method was removed as it was deprecated in a previous version. There already was a preferred
method called `generateResultMetaData()` that took an extra `Settings` parameter. To fix compilation issues simply
replace implementations of the `generateMetaData()` method with `generateResultMetaData()`. Gremlin Server has
only been calling `generateResultMetaData()` since the deprecation, so this correction should be straightforward.

===== StoreStep and AggregateStep

Note that `StoreStep` has been renamed to `AggregateLocalStep` and `AggregateStep` has been renamed to
`AggregateGlobalStep`. The renaming is important to consider if any custom `TraversalStrategies` have been written
that rely on the old step names.

See: link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2254[TINKERPOP-2254]

===== TraversalOpProcessor Side-effects

`TraversalOpProcessor` no longer holds a cache of side-effects and more generally the entire side-effect protocol has
been removed and is no longer supported in the server or drivers.
